# Per Aspera

## Concept
- Trade Wars 2002 meets Master of Orion meets timer based webgame
- procedural galaxy
- timers instead of turns per day
- progress from a single ship to a galactic empire
- colonize worlds, build stations, command fleets, mine resources, engage in ship to ship combat

## Game Loops
- trading cargo between stations and planets
- colonizing planets by placing a claim and ferrying colonists and supplies
- building stations by purchasing and transporting construction robots and resources
- mining asteroids and planets either manually with a ship or automatically with constructed facilities, selling the raw materials to stations and colonies
- engaging in combat with other players, ship to ship battles involve long range weapons and fighters/marines, ship to station combat, ship to surface combat
- setting up supply chains involving resource extraction, processing at a station or colony, manufacturing, and sale
- creation of player guilds with shared ownership of ships, territories, and facilities
- improvement of planetary status by transporting resources and people as well as building facilities and purchasing goods from the planet
